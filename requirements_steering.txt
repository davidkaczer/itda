# Requirements for model steering with HookedTransformer
# Replace vllm dependencies with transformer-lens for steering capabilities

# Core dependencies
transformer-lens>=1.9.0
torch>=2.0.0
transformers>=4.30.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
pyyaml>=6.0
fire>=0.4.0

# For async judge evaluation (if used)
openai>=1.0.0
asyncio

# Optional but recommended for better performance
accelerate>=0.20.0
bitsandbytes>=0.39.0  # For 4-bit quantization if needed

# Development/visualization (optional)
matplotlib>=3.5.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
jupyter>=1.0.0

# Note: This replaces vllm which is not compatible with HookedTransformer
# If you need vllm's speed for other tasks, you'll need separate scripts
